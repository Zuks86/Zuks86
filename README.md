ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Zukisani "Zuks" Zamela

My programming love is vanilla frontend dev (HTML, CSS, Javascript), but I am a fullstack developer who is also proficient in backend dev using languages like Java and PHP etc. I am also comfortable around server management (VMs and Containers/Docker) and networking ops (Firewalls, Port forwarding)

The purpose of this github account is to share both code snippets and libraries that I develop and use in my own projects that I also think other people may find useful.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at codewithzuks@gmail.com
